                    The fundamental rules of a computer language are represented by basic syntax. 
                    It is impossible to create functional code without these rules.
                    Each language's fundamental syntax is composed of a unique collection of rules.

            <div class = "text-l mx-12">
                <p>
                    In PHP, echo is a commonly used statement.               
                    However, we have an alternative on inputting data--print statements.
                    Does it really make a difference whether you use the 'echo' or the 'print' command? 
                    <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_echo_print.asp" id = "clickable"> W3schools 
                    </a> claims they are interchangeable, given that both are employed in the same way: 
                    to display the information. The primary distinction between print and echo is that print 
                    acts as a function while echo does not. Statements made with print has a return value of 1 
                    while echo statements no return value. The former can be used in expressions. 
                    Both can be used to display the value of either a variable or string. 
                </p>

                <p class = "my-8">
                    The use of both is demonstrated in the code samples below:
                    <div class = "flex items-center">
                        <img src = "images/echo.png" class = "h-30 w-2/5">
                        <img src = "images/echo2.png" class = "h-30 w-3/5">
                    </div>
                </p>

                <p class = "my-8"> As you can see, they output the same thing. Also, note that you can insert HTML tags
                    inside these statements to add designs to them (image 1). Pretty cool, right? </p>

            <h2 class = "almarai-extrabold text-2xl mb-6"> Variables </h2>

            <p class = "mx-12 leading-loose">
                Variables are symbols or names that represent values. Information such as text strings, numbers, 
                and other numerical or numeric values can all be stored in variables. During the execution of a script, 
                the values of variables may undergo modifications. 
                
                Some essential information concerning variables: </p>

            <div class = "ml-32 my-8">
                <ul class = "enum list-disc">
                    <li> Declaring a variable before assigning a value to it is not required in PHP.    </li>
                    <li> Depending on the value of the variable, PHP will automatically transform it 
                            to the appropriate data type.                                               </li>
                    <li> A variable can be used in multiple places once it has been declared.           </li>
                    
                    <li> Assigning a value to a variable is done through using equal sign (=).          </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
                
            <p class = "mx-12 leading-loose"> In languages like C, C++, and Java, the coder must first define the variable's name and type. 
                In PHP, types are associated with values  rather than variables, hence declaring a variable's type 
                is not necessary before using it. In this way, we have complete freedom to transform the data type 
                associated with a given variable. </p>

            <p class = "mx-12 leading-loose"> In naming variables, there are some conventions that we have to follow, namely: </p>

            <div class = "ml-32 my-8">
                <ul class = "enum list-disc">
                    <li> Its structure is $&lt;name of variable&gt;</li>
                    <li> It can have a short name ($i, $x, $v, etc.) or a descriptive name ($counter, $number, $var_score).
                    <li> It can NOT start wth a number. Conversely, it can start with an underscore character ($_feecount). </li>
                    <li> Only letters, numbers, and underscore characters are recognized. Other special characters such as ! ? or * are invalid.</li>
                    <li> Variables are case-sensitive </li>    
                    <li> Variables should not contain spaces. You may use the underscore (_) to replicate a space. </li>
